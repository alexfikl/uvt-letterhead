# UVT Letterhead in LaTeX

This is a reproduction of the UVT (West University of Timisoara) letterhead in
Latex. It uses the UVT [branding](https://www.uvt.ro/en/dcimi/identitate-vizuala/)
and [replicates this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qyRK3fjVANnRFPRCYI8VLL42Ay-z07ZM/edit).

## How to use

Copy `uvt-letterhead.sty`, `template.tex`, and `assets/` to your working directory.
You will need `sig.png` or some other signature image if you want to use one.
Modify `template.tex` as appropriate and build with `pdflatex`.

## What it looks like

## Acknowledgement

The skeleton of `uvt-letterhead.sty` was copied from
[Luke Olson's reproduction](https://github.com/lukeolson/illinois-letterhead) of
the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign letterhead, though little of
the original remains.
